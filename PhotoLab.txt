The program allows for users to apply filters on a given image; the functions being loading and saving  
images, black&white, negative, custom color, edge detection, shuffle, horizontal flip, vertical mirror, and applying   
a border filter. 

I implemented a switch case for user choice within main as it made development easy, as I could simply uncomment
each case as I completed each function. Utilizing given hints or entire equations/"pseudocode" from the assignment
manual made developing functions easier especially in the case of black&white, negative, color filter, hflip and    
vmirror. I did find it a little more challenging with the other not mentioned functions, as even given hints or
equations developing them felt tedious. However, the ending section of the manual with the mentioning important
aspects of development/implementation helped a lot.

Overall a good project.
